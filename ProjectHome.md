**A simple Python script that converts CHM files into PDF files.**

Requires:

  * chmlib
  * pychm
  * htmldoc

(Old versions require pdftk too)

All of these should be in your favourite distro repository.
Currently it works on Linux (and probably most Unixen).

If you have bugs/problems/issues/questions, as a general advice **use the Google group link at your right** to post them, not my blog or personal emails (I answer the latter, but I want bug reports etc. to be public). If after the discussion we're sure we're dealing with a true bug, post it to the Issues.

Again: Bugs, problems etc. **should be sent to the Google group**. NOT as comments to the wiki pages, blog comments or anything else. Thanks!
